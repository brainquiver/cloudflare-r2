"""Upload to an S3-compatible store, skip what is already there and retry what breaks.

On a slow or saturated uplink, a large PUT breaks often enough that a long
transfer needs several tries, and a restart must send only what is still
absent.

The tool lists the bucket first. An edit can keep the byte count, so the tool
skips a key only when the size matches and the stored SHA-256 matches the file.
Each upload stores that hash as x-amz-meta-sha256. An object from an older
version of the tool has no hash. That object keeps the size check alone, and
the run counts it.

The tool sends a file over MULTIPART_THRESHOLD as a multipart upload. A failure
after the start aborts that upload, so no unfinished upload remains.

The tool tries a failed request again, and each pause is longer than the one
before. A PUT is atomic, so a broken one leaves the bucket as it was before the
PUT.

A dataset directory goes to the bucket as its card and its curated tree, under
the name of the directory. The caller chooses the folder in the bucket that
holds the tree.
